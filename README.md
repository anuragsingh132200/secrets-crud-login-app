## SECRETS APP with CRUD and Login Feature

This application provides secure access to data with user authentication, authorization, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Features

* User authentication and authorization using Passport.js
* CRUD operations on data
* Integration with a PostgreSQL database
* Built using Node.js and Express.js

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Create a file named `.env` in your project's root directory. This file will store sensitive information like database credentials. **Do not commit this file to version control!**

   **Example `.env` file (replace with your details):**

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   PORT=3000  # Change if desired
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # For session management
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**

   Load the environment variables from the `.env` file using the `dotenv` package in your main server file (e.g., `app.js`):

   ```javascript
   require('dotenv').config();
   ```

3. **Database configuration:**

   - Replace the placeholder values in `.env` with your actual database credentials.
   - Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database named `your_database_name` set up.
   - Create the database schema and tables using a migration tool like `knex` or a manual SQL script (if needed).

### Usage

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This typically runs the application on port 3000 (or the port specified in `.env`). Access the app at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

2. **Testing:**

   Write unit and integration tests to ensure the application's functionality using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
