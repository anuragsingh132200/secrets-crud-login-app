Features

List the main capabilities of your app, such as:

User authentication and authorization using Passport.js
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data
Integration with a PostgreSQL database
Built using Node.js and Express.js
Installation

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies:

Bash
cd your-project-name
npm install
Use code with caution.
This will install all the necessary packages listed in your package.json file.

Configuration

Create a .env file:

Create a file named .env in your project's root directory. This file will store sensitive information like database credentials. Do not commit this file to your version control system!

Here's an example .env file with placeholder values:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
PORT=3000  # Change if desired
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # For session management
Set environment variables:

Load the environment variables from the .env file using the dotenv package:

JavaScript
// In your app.js or main server file
require('dotenv').config();
Use code with caution.
Database configuration:

Replace the placeholder values in .env with your actual database details.
Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database named your_database_name set up.
If needed, create the database schema and tables using a migration tool like knex or a manual SQL script.
Usage

Start the development server:

Bash
npm start
Use code with caution.
This will typically run your application on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env file). You can access the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Testing:

Write unit and integration tests to ensure your application's functionality using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
